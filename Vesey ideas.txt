Reviewing PR 54:
$ vesey 54

git worktree add pr/54
git difftool -t vimdiff master..
or
git diff | vim -
git difftool -t vimdiff -x 'vimdiff -c "wincmd c"'

or git diff and <Enter> opens a vimdiff of that file


Use vdwrap


Interface to list commits. Clicking <Enter> on a commit opens the changeset in Vim
	Maybe tig?


In vimdiff view, a key command opens the browser with a comment textarea on that line in the diff.
